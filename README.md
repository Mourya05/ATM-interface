# ATM-interface
The `ATM_Interface` program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that simulates an ATM system using Java's Swing library. It includes a `BankAccount` class to manage account operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry, and an `ATM_GUI` class for the user interface. The GUI features components such as text fields, buttons, and labels, all styled and arranged within a frame. Users can input transaction amounts and interact with buttons to deposit, withdraw, or check the balance. Validation ensures proper transactions (e.g., positive deposit amounts and sufficient funds for withdrawals), with feedback provided via message dialogs. The interface dynamically updates the balance label, offering a user-friendly experience for account management.
